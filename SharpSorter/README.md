## Sharp Sorter

This was the winning entry in a programming contest. 

Entries were written in c and other languages, but with research I discovered that c# compiled and run in windows is actually faster than c in a lot of cases. The static variables also gave a slight edge.

The program sorted a file of longs too large to be put into memory.
